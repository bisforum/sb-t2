Task 2 - QA Home assignment - masood ghasemzadeh 

A set of simple API tests for PET API microservice using Playwright.  

**Installation**
> npm install

**How to run the tests**

The following will execute all tests on all defined environments:
> npm run test

Or, test only on specific environment could be executed via:
> npm run test:staging

**Test results**
Test reports are available in HTML and json formats in 'test-results' folder.

**What could be improved**
- Test Organization: Group/Tag tests
- Edge Case Testing: Include tests for edge cases, like boundary values or invalid inputs (e.g., testing pets with extreme ages or invalid types like negative numbers, empty strings).
- Test Cleanup: Implement test cleanup logic after every test (especially for POST, PUT, and DELETE requests). Ensure that tests donâ€™t leave data behind in the system and are idempotent (tests can run repeatedly without side effects).
- Improve Logging: Implement custom logging with different log levels (e.g., info, warn, error)
- Request Validation and Schema Testing (Contract Testing)
